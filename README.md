# BunnyChessGame (very adorable)

### How to play:
- Just click "Start Game" and roll the dice
- Rabbit is always the starter because I like rabbit

### Implemented Bonus Feature:
- Special Dice: the move is basically the instruction of the original game

- FIRST MOVE: 10th chess always starts first
- SAFETY: chess above blocks with special drawing cannot be attacked
- DEFENSE: chess cannot be attacked when two chesses are staying together
- BLOCKADE: chess cannot be passed through when three chesses are staying together, except for corners
- TRAP: one of the block with special drawing will teleport player into a particular block
- EXIT: I feel like this is ruinning the game since the game will be more furstrating if I implemented that so I decided not to
- AI: it will always move the furthest piece first, unless it can't then it will move the second one, well I play it that way so I think that's pretty intellegent

### Code:
- Most of the important features are implemented inside GameManage.cs
- All display related scripts are inside the folder "UI_related"
- "unrelated" is just fun feature that I would like to include, will not affect gameplay at all
- "object" includes chess and block, chess is for player to click and block is for script to identify the location that chess should go

### Notes:
- Most of the assets are found in assets store or google, except for the gameboard I made it all by myself with texture drawn by paint
- direction of light will change if you play long enough, kinda like daytime, not sure how long it will take to have no light
- When I was making the gameboard, I messed up and rotated it 90 degree, so I rotated the gravity 90 degree
- Tree is just really something I have fun with, windzone is actually very easy to implemented, well I didn't make the assets so maybe that's the difficult part
- I hope that every single assignments of mine in this class (actually, just two) will be related to rabbit, just something I want
- There is Easter egg
- I am glad you read that far, hmmmmm, I really didn't have to do that much for this assignment and I know, I just want to treat it as an enjoyable game instead of just an assignment
- If you enjoy it, feel free to give me some feedbacks for it, I don't know how busy I will be in this semester
- but I will try to make the second assignment as enjoyable as I can

Done, and made public <3
